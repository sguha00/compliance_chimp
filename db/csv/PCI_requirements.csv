"1.3.1","1.3.1 Implement a DMZ to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.","1.3.1 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that a DMZ is implemented to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.","The DMZ is that part of the network that manages connections between the Internet (or other untrusted networks), and services that an organization needs to have available to the public (like a web server). This functionality is intended to prevent malicious individuals from accessing the organization's internal network from the Internet, or from using services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized manner."
"1.3.2","1.3.2 Limit inbound Internet traffic to IP addresses within the DMZ.","1.3.2 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that inbound Internet traffic is limited to IP addresses within the DMZ.","The DMZ is that part of the network that manages connections between the Internet (or other untrusted networks), and services that an organization needs to have available to the public (like a web server).

"1.3.3","1.3.3 Do not allow any direct connections inbound or outbound for traffic between the Internet and the cardholder data environment.","1.3.3 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify direct connections inbound or outbound are not allowed for traffic between the Internet and the cardholder data environment.","Examination of all inbound and outbound connections allows for inspection and restriction of traffic based on the source and/or destination address, as well as inspection and blocking of unwanted content, thus preventing unfiltered access between untrusted and trusted environments. This helps prevent, for example, malicious individuals from sending data they've obtained from within your network out to an external untrusted server in an untrusted network."
"1.3.4","1.3.4 Implement anti-spoofing measures to detect and block forged source IP addresses from entering the network.\n\n(For example, block traffic originating from the Internet with an internal source address.)","1.3.4 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that anti-spoofing measures are implemented, for example internal addresses cannot pass from the Internet into the DMZ.","Normally a packet contains the IP address of the computer that originally sent it so other computers in the network know where the packet came from. Malicious individuals will often try to spoof (or imitate) the sending IP address so that the target system believes the packet is from a trusted source.\n\nFiltering packets coming into the network helps to, among other things, ensure packets are not 'spoofed' to look like they are coming from an organization's own internal network."
"1.3.5","1.3.5 Do not allow unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the Internet.","1.3.5 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the Internet is explicitly authorized.","All traffic outbound from the cardholder data environment should be evaluated to ensure that it follows established, authorized rules. Connections should be inspected to restrict traffic to only authorized communications (for example by restricting source/destination addresses/ports, and/or blocking of content)."
"1.3.6","1.3.6 Implement stateful inspection, also known as dynamic packet filtering. (That is, only 'established' connections are allowed into the network.)","1.3.6 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that the firewall performs stateful inspection (dynamic packet filtering). (Only established connections should be allowed in, and only if they are associated with a previously established session.)","A firewall that performs stateful packet inspection maintains the ""state"" (or the status) for each connection through the firewall. By maintaining the 'state,' the firewall knows whether an apparent response to a previous connection is actually a valid, authorized response (since it retains each connection's status) or is malicious traffic trying to trick the firewall into allowing the connection."
"1.3.7","1.3.7 Place system components that store cardholder data (such as a database) in an internal network zone, segregated from the DMZ and other untrusted networks.","1.3.7 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that system components that store cardholder data are on an internal network zone, segregated from the DMZ and other untrusted networks.","If cardholder data is located within the DMZ, it is easier for an external attacker to access this information, since there are fewer layers to penetrate. Securing system components that store cardholder data in an internal network zone that is segregated from the DMZ and other untrusted networks by a firewall can prevent unauthorized network traffic from reaching the system component.\n\n***Note:*** *This requirement is not intended to apply to temporary storage of cardholder data in volatile memory.*"
"1.3.8.a","1.3.8 Do not disclose private IP addresses and routing information to unauthorized parties.\n\n***Note:*** *Methods to obscure IP addressing may include, but are not limited to:*\n\n-   Network Address Translation (NAT)\n\n-   Placing servers containing cardholder data behind proxy servers/firewalls,\n\n-  Removal or filtering of route advertisements for private networks that employ registered addressing,\n\n-   Internal use of RFC1918 address space instead of registered addresses.","1.3.8.a Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that methods are in place to prevent the disclosure of private IP addresses and routing information from internal networks to the Internet.","Restricting the disclosure of internal or private IP addresses is essential to prevent a hacker 'learning' the IP addresses of the internal network, and using that information to access the network.\n\nMethods used to meet the intent of this requirement may vary depending on the specific networking technology being used.

This allows an entity to gain a better understanding of their potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against attacks.\n\nA penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that may include exploiting identified vulnerabilities. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps a penetration tester will perform in order to plan the testing strategy, although it is not the only step. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.\n\nPenetration testing is generally a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, the tester uses their knowledge of systems to penetrate into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a means to gain access to an application server, they will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources the server has access to. In this way, a tester is able to simulate the methods performed by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment. Penetration testing techniques will be different for different organizations, and the type, depth, and complexity of the testing will depend on the specific environment and the organization's risk assessment."
