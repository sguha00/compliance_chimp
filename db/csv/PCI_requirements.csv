Archived cryptographic keys should only be used for decryption/verification purposes."
"3.6.6","If manual clear-text cryptographic key management operations are used, these operations must be managed using split knowledge and dual control (for example, requiring two or three people, each knowing only their own key component, to reconstruct the whole key).\n\nNote: Examples of manual key management operations include, but are not limited to: key generation, transmission, loading, storage and destruction.
