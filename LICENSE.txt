The AGPL license differs from the other GNU licenses in that it was built for
network software. You can distribute modified versions if you keep track of the
changes and the date you made them. Pull Requests to the Compliance chimp github
repository is the required method. As per usual with GNU licenses, you must
license derivatives under AGPL. It provides the same restrictions and freedoms
as the GPLv3 but with an additional clause which makes it so that source code
must be distributed along with web publication. Since web sites and services are
never distributed in the traditional sense, the AGPL is the GPL of the web.
